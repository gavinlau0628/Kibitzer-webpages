# Kibitzer-webpages
Kibitzer is a search results aggregator for Craigslist. Based on "Search Profiles" created by users, it searches Craigslist and emails a report spreadsheet of what it found on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Kibitzerâ€™s Search Profile is a user generated set of parameters, containing information such as whitelisted words, blacklisted words, and the desired section of Craigslist. Once Kibitzer finds a search result that matches the Search Profile specs, it will add it to its database to later be sent to users that are subscribed to that Search Profile in the intervals described above.
